    "Normalization is a process in database design that focuses on structuring a relational database. The goal of normalization is to to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Particularly, normal forms primarily addresses the three kinds of anomalies in database usage: insertion anomaly, update anomaly, and deletion anomaly [1]. In this activity, a music library is transformed from a UNF to 1NF to 2NF then to 3NF database highlighting its strengths and weaknesses addressed for each stage of the normal form."

    "The following code segment demonstrates the 1st normal form (1NF) in a database. The key difference with 1NF and UNF is the absence of any tables as an attribute entry. Previously, in UNF, each entry contained a list of songs under the song attribute.

    "In the following code segment, the 1NF table is further normalized to be 2nd normal form (2NF). In this normal form, the table must be free from duplicates. In the previous 1NF table, the duplicates come in the repetition of album entries per song. To transform this, the album_id serves as the primary key for the list of albums. This serves as the candidate key for the secondary table as well. This secondary table contains a list of songs only containing the candidate key (album_id) as reference to relate to the first table. In the following code, two tables are generated namely the album_library and song_library. The generation of the second table allows the existence of the albums independent of the songs in edge cases such as removal or addition of songs to an already published album. The 2NF removes redundancies and prevents some level of insertion, addition, and deletion anomalies in the database."

The generated databases highlights their various weaknesses which is addressed by added complexity by the following normal form. In this activity, UNF's lack of query power due to list or table elements is addressed by 1NF. 1NF's redundant and repetitive elements is addressed by 2NF by splitting these elements into another table. Then, 3NF addresses the 2NF weaknesses by removing any form of dependencies while leaving only relations and candidate keys which allows each table and attribute to be editable without affecting other attributes.
